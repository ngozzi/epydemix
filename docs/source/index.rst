Welcome to epydemix's documentation!
====================================

**Epydemix** is a Python package for epidemic modeling. It provides tools to create, calibrate, and analyze epidemic models, allowing users to simulate the spread of infectious diseases using different compartmental models, contact layers, and calibration techniques. Epydemix is designed to work with the [epydemix-data](https://github.com/ngozzi/epydemix-data/) package to load population and contact matrix data.

Features:
---------
- Define and simulate compartmental models (e.g., SIR, SEIR).
- Integrate real-world population data with contact matrices.
- Calibrate models using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC).
- Visualize simulation results with built-in plotting tools.
- Extensible framework for modeling interventions and policy scenarios.
